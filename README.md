A quick hangman game where you have to find a word by guessing letters like the exemple bellow

You start with 8 lives and if you do to many wrong guesses it's game over

There's a protection implemented so you can't guess the same letter twice (be careful, guessing the same word twice counts as 2 guesses)

You can change the word_list file to customize the game, each word should be on a different line (don't forget to change the number of words in the hangman.h file)
